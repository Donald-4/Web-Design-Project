              Country History: Overview of England's Timeline
            </h1>
            <div class="col-md-6 p-3">
              <h5>Prehistoric to Roman Britain (Before 43 CE - 410 CE)</h5>
              England was first inhabited by Celtic tribes. In 43 CE, the Romans
              invaded, establishing Roman Britain. This period brought
              infrastructure, roads, and the iconic Hadrian's Wall.
              <br /><br />

              <h5>The Anglo-Saxons and Viking Age (410 CE - 1066 CE)</h5>
              After Roman withdrawal, Anglo-Saxon kingdoms formed, with key
              figures like King Alfred the Great. The Vikings arrived in the 9th
              century, leading to conflict and settlement in parts of England.
              <br /><br />
              <h5>The Tudor Dynasty (16th Century)</h5>
              The Tudor era brought significant religious and political change.
              Henry VIII’s break from the Catholic Church and the rise of the
              Church of England defined the period, followed by the cultural
              flourishing under Elizabeth I.
              <br /><br />

              <h5>
                The English Civil War and the Rise of Constitutional Monarchy
                (17th Century)
              </h5>
              In the 1600s, the English Civil War between monarchy and
              Parliament resulted in the temporary overthrow of the monarchy.
              The Glorious Revolution of 1688 established constitutional
              monarchy with William and Mary.
            </div>

            <div class="col-md-6 p-3">
              <h5>The Norman Conquest (1066)</h5>
              In 1066, William the Conqueror defeated King Harold at the Battle
              of Hastings. This marked the beginning of Norman rule,
              dramatically changing England’s culture, language, and feudal
              system.<br /><br />

              <h5>
                Plantagenet Rule and the Hundred Years' War (12th - 15th
                Century)
              </h5>
              The Plantagenet dynasty brought England to its peak of medieval
              power. The Hundred Years’ War (1337-1453) with France defined this
              era, while the signing of the Magna Carta in 1215 limited royal
              power and laid the groundwork for democracy.
              <br />
              <br />
              <h5>The Industrial Revolution (18th - 19th Century)</h5>
              The Industrial Revolution transformed England from an agrarian
              society to the world’s first industrialized nation. This period
              also saw the expansion of the British Empire to become the largest
              empire in history.
              <br /><br />
              <h5>The 20th Century: World Wars and Modern England</h5>
              England played central roles in both World Wars, which led to the
              decline of the British Empire and the rise of a modern,
              multicultural nation. In the latter half of the century, England
              became a global leader in culture, finance, and technology.

              <h5>Alfred the Great (849-899)</h5>
              King of Wessex, Alfred is remembered for defending England against
              Viking invasions and laying the foundations for a unified English
              kingdom.
              <br /><br />

              <h5>William the Conqueror (1028-1087)</h5>
              The first Norman King of England, William's victory at the Battle
              of Hastings in 1066 altered the course of English history,
              introducing Norman rule, feudalism, and the Domesday Book.
              <br /><br />
              <h5>Winston Churchill (1874-1965)</h5>
              Prime Minister during World War II, Churchill’s leadership and
              speeches were instrumental in leading Britain through the war
              against Nazi Germany.

              the defeat of the Spanish Armada and promoting cultural

              Leader of the Parliamentarians during the English Civil War,
              Cromwell played a key role in the execution of King Charles I and
              the establishment of the Commonwealth, briefly ending the

                        <h5>The Saxons, Vikings, and Norman Conquest</h5>
                        After the Romans left, the Anglo-Saxons unified parts of England, but Viking invasions fractured
                        the land. In 1066, William the Conqueror from Normandy defeated King Harold at the Battle of
                        Hastings, forever changing England’s language, culture, and governance.
